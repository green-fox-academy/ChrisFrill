# Expressions and Control Flow
## Java
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

##IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is a Java integrated development environment (IDE) for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition,[3] and in a proprietary commercia edition. Both can be used for commercial development.

##statement
Java statement is just an instruction that explains what should happen.

##variables
A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

You must declare all variables before they can be used.

###declaration
To be able to use a variable it needs to be declared. Declaring variables is normally the first thing that happens in any program.
